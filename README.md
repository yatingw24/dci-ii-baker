# a d3 project on underfunded Non-STEM PhD Students

This project is a visual-story with charts made using d3, which sheds light on the disparity of the stipend different fields of study receive. The first part includes a multi-line chart explaining the stipend gap over time, while the second part include an interactive map visualization displaying graduate school stipend data across the United States. Built with D3.js, the map shows individual schools as circles sized proportionally to their stipend amounts and color-coded by institution type (public vs. private).
