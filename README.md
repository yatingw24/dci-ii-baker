# a d3 project on underfunded Non-STEM PhD Students

This project is an interactive exploration of funding gaps across disciplines and institutions.The first part includes a multi-line chart explaining the stipend gap over time, while the second part include an interactive map visualization displaying graduate school stipend data across the United States. Built with D3.js, the map shows individual schools as circles sized proportionally to their stipend amounts and color-coded by institution type (public vs. private).

## Technical Stack

D3.js (scales, TopoJSON, SVG paths, mouse events)

JavaScript (ES6 modules, Promise.all for async data loading)

Data: Curated from university reports + U.S. News rankings
